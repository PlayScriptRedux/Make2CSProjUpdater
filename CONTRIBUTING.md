Guidelines
==========

As this utility was need to assist the PlayScript Reduc project, it uses the same contribution guidelines:

When contributing to the PlayScript Redux project, please follow the [Mono Coding Guidelines][1].  Mono has been using a coding style for many years, please make your patches conform to these guidelines.

[1] [http://www.mono-project.com/Coding_Guidelines](http://www.mono-project.com/Coding_Guidelines)

Etiquette
=========

In general, we do not accept patches that merely shuffle code around, split classes in multiple files, reindent the code or are the result of running a refactoring tool on the source code.  This is done for
three reasons: (a) we have our own coding guidelines; (b) Some modules are imported from upstream sources and we want to respect their coding guidelines and (c) it destroys valuable history that is often used to investigate bugs, regressions and problems.
